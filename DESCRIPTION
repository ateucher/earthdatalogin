Description: Bindings to NASA EarthData Login application programming interface,
  providing convenient authentication and access to Cloud-hosted NASA EarthData
  products. Much of NASA's public data catalogs hosted and maintained by its 12
  Distributed Active Archive Centers ("DAACs") are now made available on the 
  Amazon Web Services "S3" bucket.  However, accessing this data through the
  standard S3 API is restricted to requests coming from within Amazon's
  "us-west-2" Data Center in Portland, Oregon, which allows NASA to avoid being
  charged "data egress" rates for data transfers outside of the hosting data
  center. Public access over HTTPS is possible, but requires authentication
  with a seperate API routed through cloudfront using Bearer tokens. This
  package seeks to streamline that authentication process, making access to this
  wide range of earth observation data from any location straight forward and
  compatible with R packages that are widely used with cloud native earth 
  observation data (such as "terra"", "sf"", etc.)
